      <td>If you don't feel comfortable around homosexuals, is it okay to request to change seats if you are seated next to one on a plane?I was recently asked this question by a friend. I thought about the answer for a while and then decided that yes, it would be perfectly acceptable to ask to move your seat if you were uncomfortable with sitting next to someone of the same sex.The reason why I think it is okay to do so is because there is no law against being gay or lesbian in America. It is not illegal to be homosexual. Therefore, it should not be considered discriminatory to ask to move your seat if you are uncomfortable with sitting next to someone who is gay or lesbian.However, I also believe that we need to be careful when making such requests. We must make sure that our actions do not come across as hateful or bigoted. For example, if you are seated next to a gay man and he asks you to switch seats, it would be best to politely decline his offer rather than getting angry at him for asking.</td>
